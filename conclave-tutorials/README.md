# Conclave Tutorials

## How this repo works

This repository holds tutorial code for the Conclave SDK. They are referenced by the [SDK documentation site](https://docs.conclave.net/). To enable easy access for users, the default branch is NOT master, but rather the current release of Conclave and the tutorials use that version of Conclave. The master branch instead uses the next SNAPSHOT version.
